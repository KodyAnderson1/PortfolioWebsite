# Portfolio Website
URL: [Portfolio Site](https://kanderson.dev/)

This project was inspired by a tutorial [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-portfolio-with-reactjs-and-bootstrap/).



## Concept / Project Overview
Primarily leveraging React, this application uses (React) components and custom CSS classes to style and customize my portfolio website. The intended purpose of following a tutorial was to familiarize me with CSS features such as z-index, text manipulation, and creating shapes/lines. Other styles used were creating abstract components to map over data to create reusable components.

## Languages and Libraries
- Javascript
- React
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- HTML
- Firebase (Hosting)

## Installation Instructions
To install on your local machine, pull the GitHub repo, navigate into the project's root directory, type `npm install` and then `npm start` in your console, and a localhost version of the app should open in your default browser. To see an active application instance, see the URL at the top.

## Future Development
- Update the experience & timeline section to map over data to create the section instead of hardcoded text and redundant use of code.
- Use a database to hold data

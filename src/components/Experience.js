                  Started to take more in-program classes such as I started taking more in-program
                  classes, such as <b>Algorithm and Program Design</b>, where we used C++, learned
                  about topics such as pointers, pass-by-reference, and memory management, and
                  started using Github. <b>Intermediate Programming</b> was my introduction to
                  Object-Oriented Programming (with Java). <b>Server-Side Programming</b>, where I
                  learned Javascript and utilized Node.js and a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to build
                  APIs and server-side web applications. <b>Database Systems</b>, where we learned
                  how to design and develop relational databases using SQL.

                  Classes from this semester were <b>Data Mining</b> where we used the R programming
                  language with R Studio to mine different data sets. Another notable class was{" "}
                  <b>Discrete Structures</b> where we learned about mathematical logic, different
                  types of encryptions, proofs, and trees/graphs.

                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Data Structures & Algorithms I</b>, where we learned about best/worst case time
                  analysis, searching and sorting algorithms, and data structures such as linked
                  lists, heaps, hash constructs, and trees/graphs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Software Engineering I</b>. This class primarily consisted of learning how to
                  work in software development (using Java) as a team. We used the scrum process and
                  its sprints to mark project iterations. We also used Trello for our backlog, with
                  Github as our version control. We also learned different design pattern concepts
                  such as Singleton classes, Abstract Factory, Builder, Object Pool, and
                  prototyping. I also learned about Object Oriented concepts like the SOLID
                  principles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Advanced Computer Programming</b>. Utilized Java to learn about regular
                  expressions, network programming, threading, and coding with relational databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Client-Side Programming</b>. Primarily focused on building single-page
                  applications with React and bootstrap, which helped promote mobile-first
                  development. I also learned more about Javascript and JSX with React. We also
                  learned Google's Firebase while integrating its hosting, real-time database, and
                  user authentication into our semester-long project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Intro to Computer Organization</b>. We learned about the MIPS assembly language
                  and overall computer organization focusing on binary concepts such as binary
                  conversion, logic gates, grey codes, and other similar topics.
